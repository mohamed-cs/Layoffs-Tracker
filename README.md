# Layoffs-Tracker

Tech firms around the globe are fighting the economic slowdown. The slow consumer spending, higher interest rates by central banks, and strong dollars overseas are hinting toward a possible recession and tech firms have started laying employees off. This economic slowdown has made Meta recently fire 13% of its workforce, which amounts to more than 11,000 employees.

The data availability is from when COVID-19 was declared a pandemic in March 2020 to the present (Jan 2023).

So I decided to Analyze the layoffs data and try to find some insights into this problem

Steps :
1: Understand the Project Needed
2: Defining the question.
3: Collecting the data. ( https://layoffs.fyi/ )
4: Cleaning the data. ( Python )
5: Analyzing the data. ( Python )
6: Data Visualization & Storytelling ( Power BI)

That I answered some questions with it like :

1: How many countries were affected by Layoffs?
2: How many companies were affected by Layoffs?
3: Hom many industries were affected by Layoffs?
3: Show the Companies and their industry for every country
4: Show the percentage of industries' layoffs for every country
5: what are the top 5 industries that were affected by Layoffs?
6: what are the top 5 countries that were affected by Layoffs?
7: In which year the layoff' was reached its extreme point?
8: show the change of layoffs over time
