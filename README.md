# Layoffs-Tracker
<p>
Tech firms around the globe are fighting the economic slowdown. The slow consumer spending, higher interest rates by central banks, and strong dollars overseas are hinting toward a possible recession and tech firms have started laying employees off. This economic slowdown has made Meta recently fire 13% of its workforce, which amounts to more than 11,000 employees.

<p>
The data availability is from when COVID-19 was declared a pandemic in March 2020 to the present (Jan 2023).
</p>

<p>
So I decided to Analyze the layoffs data and try to find some insights into this problem
</p>

Steps :
<ol>
  <li>Understand the Project Needed</li>
  <li>Defining the question</li>
  <li>Collecting the data. ( https://layoffs.fyi/ )</li>
  <li>Cleaning the data. ( Python )</li>
  <li>Analyzing the data. ( Python )</li>
  <li>Data Visualization & Storytelling ( Power BI)</li>
</ol>

That I answered some questions with it like :

<ul>
  <li>How many countries were affected by Layoffs?</li>
  <li>How many companies were affected by Layoffs?</li>
  <li>Hom many industries were affected by Layoffs?</li>
  <li>Show the Companies and their industry for every country</li>
  <li>Show the percentage of industries' layoffs for every country</li>
  <li>what are the top 5 industries that were affected by Layoffs?</li>
  <li>what are the top 5 countries that were affected by Layoffs?</li>
  <li>In which year the layoff' was reached its extreme point?</li>
  <li>show the change of layoffs over time</li>
</ul>
